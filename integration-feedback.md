My overall experience was really good. I think the docs are well-structured, the diagram flows help a lot with integration, and this is not very common in docs from my experience.  

There are a lot of flows, but after reading a few times, you can understand both what Endaoment is about and how it works.  

The pattern where the end of one file leads to another is very good for integrating parts, except for the **Search for an Organization** section, where I think this pattern is a little broken, which caused me some confusion.  

Also, the URLs not being set to development was a bit frustrating because I didnâ€™t get any errors about using a production URL. I know this is well-documented in the QuickStart, but during the integration process, I had to put in extra effort to change each one.  

Thank you for this opportunity, and hopefully, my comments can help improve the docs a little.
